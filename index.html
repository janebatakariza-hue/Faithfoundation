<p1>I have passed through different styles of life where loved and where noone gives you value but all of that is meaningless without God. So your air to breathe and your food to feed on everyday.</p1>

<p2> Testimony is what prooves that we find meaning in the work God has done. It not only prooves us thankful to God but also builds others who are facing same difficulties!</p2>

<p3> God has created us to worship and praise Him since He could do all the things Himself exept worshipping.So if you have been saved by His grace then you have to do His will and worship Him.</p3>
