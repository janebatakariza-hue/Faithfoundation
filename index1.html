    🌱About the Faith foundation
</h1>
    <p>
Faith foundation is more of a family than an organisation that aims at spreading the gospel in the world through different impactful actions such as increasing the awareness of Jesus to those who haven't approached Him yet!

        🙏Understanding the need of God 
    </h1>
    <p> 
        So, at Faith foundation, we give chances to people to give out their feelings about the kingdom of God. We are not here to judge but indeed we just help them improve their understanding not just so as to laugh at them but to build on how they understand things so as to keep them redirected in God's ways.
