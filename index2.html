    <h2>
        Personal background in relation to the Faith foundation.

    </h2>
    <p5> My name is Jane BATAKARIZA a Rwandan girl proud to be a christian . <br>So times back in the times i met times that made me understand that life without God would be more meaningful and enjoyful.🧑‍🤝‍🧑Then with the influence of my peers who i thought were driving me into the right thing, I ended up doing things that  I regret until today.I lately found out that I was really wrong and decided to follow Christ after getting thousand advices from my sister and also preachingd from the church. Later on I realise It was all meaningless and I started to follow Jesus🙏. Throughout that uneasy and tough life God was always there for me and I realised people live with you in good but in bad they leave you though God never let me down. That made me feel that I have a lot to give out to the people that still don't understand the need of Christ to their lives and also get all sorts of aid in a way that they feel  understood and know why they have to follow Jesus not just judging them but allowing them to give their insights about different aspects!👌 </p5>

    <h2>The birth of Faith foundation</h2>
<p5>🌟 Our Story – Faith Foundation <br> Faith Foundation grew from a personal journey of faith, hope, and love. We exist to inspire hearts, nurture souls, and bring people closer to God. The idea came from a group of girls who joined hands together to give their contributions towards bringing more people closer to God and walking with them through the writing of their unique salvation stories!</p5>
