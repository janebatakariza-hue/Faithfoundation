    <h2>
        Personal background in relation to the Faith foundation.

    </h2>
    <p>So times back in the times i met times that made me understand that life without God would be more meaningful and enjoyful.🧑‍🤝‍🧑Then with the influence of my peers who i thought were driving me into the right thing.I lately found out that I was really wrong and decided to follow Christ after getting thousand advices from my sister and also a preaching. That made me feel that I have a lot to give out to the people that still don't understand the need of Christ to their lives and also get all sorts of aid in a way that they are understood!👌 </p>
